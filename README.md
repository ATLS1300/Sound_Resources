# Sound Resources

This repository stores **modules** (also called libraries). You can download the module and import it as you would other libraries. 
The module file (.py) and sound file (.wav, .mp3) **must be in the same folder as your VS Code working folder and script.**

Example code demonstrates use. There is a video walking through the SR_pygameExample.py

## Importing modules does not count as borrowed code.

**For the soundResponse library, you must install pydub.**
In the VS Code terminal type:
`pip install pydub`
Wait until install finshes, then run/use code.

**For the micSound library, you must install sounddevice.**
In the VS Code terminal type:
`pip install sounddevice`
Wait until install finshes, then run/use code.

## How to use this code
1. TRY FIRST - Sure, you can come here and look at and copy the code and produce the goals that you want, but you're taking this class to UNDERSTAND how to code. So try to meet the pseudocode goals, THEN look at/copy the parts needed to fix any errors.
2. ASK QUESTIONS - If there's part of the code you don't understand, or if we implemented a solution differently than you, ask about it! Bad programmers use code they don't understand! Don't be a bad programmer.
3. AUGMENT - Demonstrate your understanding by changing the code. Change colors, size, and/or the position of the pattern. Change the organization of the code to suit your goals. You will get higher points for changing ANY code that you borrow!
4. CITE EXAMPLES - While using this code in your programs without citation will not mean plagiarism (because we work on it together in class), you should still practice citing code. You would add something like:
`# Modified code from class code`
